## Solution
Since the only provided info was a Wikipedia link, we assumed that the flag would be somewhere in the Wikipedia edit history. Navigate to https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Flag&action=history, and view the diffs between each change. We kept going back edit-by-edit until we found one that could be relevant. Eventually we found this edit: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Flag&diff=next&oldid=675431673
