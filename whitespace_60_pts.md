# Whitespace (60 pts)



---

## Statement
I’ve found this [java program](./files/whitespacejava.java) on someone’s computer that looks fishy.

## Hint
I wonder, is that really Java?


---

## Solution
The problem name and hint made it pretty clear to us that the problem had to do with the esoteric programming language [Whitespace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_(programming_language). All we did was find a [whitespace program interpreter](https://github.com/hostilefork/whitespacers/blob/master/python/interpreter.py), and run the file with it, and got the flag.
